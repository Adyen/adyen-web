Improved the user experience for the UPI component:

- **On mobile devices,** the QR code flow has been removed. Shoppers will be guided to pay with their installed UPI apps (Intent flow) or by entering their UPI ID.
- **On desktop devices,** the QR code flow is now the default, with the option to pay via UPI ID also available.
- Added a validation alert to guide shoppers to select a UPI app before proceeding with the payment.
- Updated instructional labels for better clarity across all payment modes.
