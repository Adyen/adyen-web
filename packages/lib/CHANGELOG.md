## 6.0.0

## Breaking Changes

### General

- Drop-in/Components is no longer supported on Internet Explorer 11.
- If you integrate with npm, we've changed how you import Drop-in/Components to reduce the bundle size.
- If you integrate with embedded scripts, we changed how we expose the AdyenCheckout and Drop-in/Components on the window object.
- We've changed how you create an instance of Drop-in or Component.
- For the `onSubmit()` event handler, you now need to resolve/reject an actions object to continue or halt the payment flow.
- For the `onAdditionalDetails()` event handler, you now need to resolve/reject an actions object to continue or halt the payment flow.
- The `onPaymentCompleted()` event is no longer triggered for failed payments, instead the `onPaymentFailed()` event is triggered.
- The `showPayButton` parameter now defaults to true.
- The `onValid()` event is removed.
- The `setStatusAutomatically` prop is no longer supported. If a payment is successful or if it fails, the component is kept in loading state and merchant must handle it accordingly.
- We've changed how you style Drop-in/Components to give you more fine-grained control by using custom CSS properties. Update your CSS styles accordingly.
- The `countryCode` property is now mandatory. It must be set directly in the `AdyenCheckout` configuration object, or in the /sessions request.
- The `showFormInstruction` property is no longer supported.
- When instantiating `AdyenCheckout`, you can no longer set the configuration property `installmentOptions`. It must be set in the Card Component configuration instead.
- You can no longer set the configuration property `paymentMethodsConfiguration` when initializing `AdyenCheckout. Instead, set it in the Drop-in configuration.
- TypeScript types are now imported directly from the root of the package, for example: `import type { CardConfiguration } from '@adyen/adyen-web';`

### Payment method specific

#### Express payment methods

- For Google Pay express, the event handler `onPaymentDataChanged()` now works only when the Component configuration property `isExpress` is set to true.
- For Apple Pay express, the event handlers `onShippingContactSelected()` and `onShippingMethodSelected()` now work only when the Component configuration property `isExpress` is set to true.
- For Paypal Express, the `onShippingChange()` event handler is no longer supported. Migrate to the `onShippingAddressChange()` and `onShippingOptionsChange()` event handlers.
- The `onShopperDetails()` event for PayPal is renamed to `onAuthorized()` and it must be resolved or rejected to finalize the payment.
- For Google Pay, the `isAvailable()` method does not return a boolean flag anymore. Instead, the promise is resolved when the payment is available and rejected otherwise.

#### Card payment methods

- The Card Component configuration property `showBrandsUnderCardNumber` is no longer supported.
- The `challengeWindowSize` configuration parameter can no longer be set inside a `threeDS2` object within `paymentMethodsConfiguration`.
- The Custom Card Component is renamed from `securedfields` to `CustomCard` and created as: `new CustomCard()`

#### Other payment methods

- For PayPal, the `onCancel()` event handler is no longer supported. To detect when the PayPal lightbox is closed, listen to the `onError()` event with error type `CANCEL`.
- For Klarna, the `token` property is replaced with the `authorization_token` from the `/payments/details` request.
- For Adyen Giving, you now need to integrate with the Giving Campaign Manager Component.
- We no longer support the payment method QiwiWallet.

#### Partial payments

- The `onOrderCreated()` event is renamed to `onOrderUpdated()`.

## New

- `onPaymentMethodsRequest()` is a new event, which is triggered when a partial payment is made and the associated order isn't fully paid. Use the even handler to request payment methods for a new payment.
- `onPaymentFailed()` is a new event, which is triggered when a payment fails. Previously, this event was part of `onPaymentCompleted()`.
- You can now disable the final animation after a successful or failed payment in Drop-in, by setting `disableFinalAnimation` to true.
- Shoppers can now confirm the payment by pressing the Enter key. If the payment has a validation issue, an error is displayed in the Drop-in/Components interface.
- You can customize, or prevent, the Enter keypress behavior by implementing an `onEnterKeyPressed()` event handler on AdyenCheckout.
- We have added support for 6 more locales: Catalan (ca-ES), Icelandic (is-IS), Bulgarian (bg-BG), Estonian (et-EE), Latvian (lv-LV) and Lithuanian (lt-lT).
- We have added support for Apple Pay Order tracking.
- We have added support for tree shaking when integrating through npm.

## Changed

- `onPaymentCompleted()` now works for both Sessions and Advanced flow.
- We have replaced input field placeholder texts with permanently visible contextual elements to enhance the accessibility and UX. You can still apply and customize placeholders.
- For Google Pay and Apple Pay, the `onAuthorized()` event is now triggered before the `onSubmit()` event. The `onAuthorized()` event must be resolved in order to proceed with the payment flow.
- We have improved AVS checks for GooglePay and ApplePay by adding the billing address to `state.data` if available during payment method authorization.
- Drop-in no longer uses radio buttons by default.
- The WeChatPay timer now defaults to 30 minutes.
