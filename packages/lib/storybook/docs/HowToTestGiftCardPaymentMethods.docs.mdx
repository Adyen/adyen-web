# How To Test GiftCard Payment Methods

If you're looking for a specific gift card component, you can test various gift card types using our generic [Giftcard](/story/components-giftcard--default) component story:

1. Navigate to **Components → Giftcard** in the Storybook navigation
2. In the Controls panel, modify the following parameters:
   - **countryCode**: Set the appropriate country code if needed
   - **componentConfiguration.brand**: Set the gift card brand (e.g., 'givex', 'svs')

The Giftcard component will automatically handle the specific gift card flow based on the type you specify. This allows you to test any supported gift card without needing a dedicated component for each brand.

For a complete list of available payment method types, refer to the [Adyen Documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/payment-methods).
