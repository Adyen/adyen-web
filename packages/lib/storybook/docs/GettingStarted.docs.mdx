Welcome to the Adyen Web Components Storybook. This interactive documentation allows you to explore and test our payment components in isolation.

## Resources

- **GitHub Repository**: [adyen/adyen-web](https://github.com/adyen/adyen-web)
- **Official Documentation**: [Adyen Docs](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/web-drop-in)

## Testing Components

Our Storybook is organized into three main sections:

### 1. Dropin
This section contains the Drop-in component, which provides a complete payment interface that automatically displays the available payment methods based on your configuration.

### 2. Components
This section contains the core payment method components that merchants can integrate into their checkout flows. These are the production-ready components that handle specific payment methods like Cards, PayPal, and more.

### 3. Internal Elements
This section includes internal components and utilities used within the Adyen Web library. These are primarily for development purposes and provide insight into the building blocks of our payment components.
