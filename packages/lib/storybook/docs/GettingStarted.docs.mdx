# Getting Started

Welcome to the Adyen Web Components Storybook. This interactive documentation allows you to explore and test our payment components in isolation.

## Resources

- **GitHub Repository**: [adyen/adyen-web](https://github.com/adyen/adyen-web)
- **Official Documentation**: [Adyen Docs](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/web-drop-in)

## Testing Components

Our Storybook is organized into three main sections:

### 1. Dropin
This section contains the Drop-in component, which provides a complete payment interface that automatically displays the available payment methods based on your configuration.

### 2. Components
This section contains the core payment method components that merchants can integrate into their checkout flows. These are the production-ready components that handle specific payment methods like Cards, PayPal, and more.

### 3. Internal Elements
This section includes internal components and utilities used within the Adyen Web library. These are primarily for development purposes and provide insight into the building blocks of our payment components.

## Can't Find a Component?

If you're looking for a payment method component that isn't explicitly listed in the Components section, it may be a redirect-based payment method. These can be tested using our generic [Redirect](/story/components-redirect--default) component.

### Testing Redirect Payment Methods

Many payment methods use a redirect flow where the customer is redirected to the payment provider's page. You can test these using the [Redirect](/story/components-redirect--default) component story:

1. Navigate to **Components → Redirect** in the Storybook navigation
2. In the Controls panel, modify the following parameters:
   - **countryCode**: Set the appropriate country code (e.g., 'NL' for Netherlands, 'HK' for Hong Kong)
   - **componentConfiguration.type**: Set the payment method type (tx_variant) (e.g., 'ideal', 'alipay_hk')

The Redirect component will automatically handle the specific payment method flow based on the type you specify. This allows you to test any redirect-based payment method without needing a dedicated component for each one.

For a complete list of available payment method types, refer to the [Adyen Documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/payment-methods).
